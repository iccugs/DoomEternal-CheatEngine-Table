# DoomEternal-Trainer
Just some cheats that I made for Doom Eternal for the latest DLC (Ancient Gods Part 2).

The CT file is the cheat engine table that I made using a pointer address for the health value and some AutoAssembly scripts for everything else.

The rest of the repository is an actual fully fleshed out trainer that runs in a C++ console window for Windows.

If you don't want to go through the trouble of compiling everything from source, just go into the x64/debug folders and use the DOOMEternalTrainer.exe file.
