# DoomEternal-Trainer
Doom Eternal c++ trainer and accompanying cheat engine table for the latest DLC (Ancient Gods Part 2 Update 6.4).
<br>
<br>
As of right now, only infinite health, armor, ammo, radiation and oxygen suit, hammer, and sword  work.  This is a major work in progress since the last update.
<br>
<br>
The CT file is the cheat engine table that I made using a pointer address for the health value and some AutoAssembly scripts for everything else.
<br>
<br>
The rest of the repository is an actual fully fleshed out trainer that runs in a C++ console window for Windows.
<br>
<br>
If you don't want to go through the trouble of compiling everything from source, just go into the x64/debug folders and use the DOOMEternalTrainer.exe file.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTES:
<br>
1. On the cheat engine table, you will see two auto-assembly scripts under "Health/Ammo."
<br>
You can only pick one or the other because of the addresses they modify.
